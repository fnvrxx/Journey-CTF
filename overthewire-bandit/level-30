# There is a git repository at 
# ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit29-git/repo via the port 2220.The 
# password for the user bandit29-git is the same as for the user bandit29.

# Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.
solve:
- same as level 29,but using command git branch -a to know all the branch
- as we know we in branch master and the clue is password not in 
production
- so we need to switch the branch on dev, try using command "git checkout 
dev"
-using command "README.md" and voila you get a password for the next level
