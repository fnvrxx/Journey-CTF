# To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in 
# the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. 
# The password for this level can be found in the usual place 
# (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.
solve :
-there a file read,write,and exec called "bandit20-do".
-in descr we need know that files for password usually in /etc/bandit_pass
-firstly, using command ls -l to know who is can using that file (as we 
know it file in name bandit20)
- let's try running file exec with command "./bandit20-do".It say that 
"Run a command as another user Examplae: ./bandit20-do id"
-let's another try using command for that example and it say 
uid=11019(bandit19) gid=11019(bandit19) euid=11020(bandit20) 
groups=11019(bandit19)
- it means we need to exec using password bandit20 to do that using 
command "./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20"
- voila you get the next password "0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO"
