# A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for 
# bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit 
# pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through 
# all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
# You do not need to create new connections each time
solve :
- to solve this, we need to understand to write bash terminal
- so let's try using "netcat localhost 30002 with password bandit24"
- it looks like wrong, so try to understand the brute-force
- try write bash  "for i in {1..10}; do echo "$1"; done" it will print 
iteration 1 to 10
- so let's try brute-force with bash "for i in {0000..9999}; do echo 
"iCi86ttT4KSNe1armKiwbQNmB3YJP3q4 $i"; done | netcat localhost 320000
- voila you get a next password iCi86ttT4KSNe1armKiwbQNmB3YJP3q4
