# The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, 
preceded by several ‘=’ characters.
solve:
- first using command "strings" able to 'human-readable' because file data.txt is a binary
- after that, as we can see 'preceded by several "=" characters' so using command grep to show "="
- command strings data.txt | grep "="
- the password is :FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey
