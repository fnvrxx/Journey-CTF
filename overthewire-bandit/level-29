# There is a git repository at 
# ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo via the port 2220. The 
# password for the user bandit28-git is the same as for the user bandit28.

# Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.
solve:
- same as level-28
- afterwards, there a file called "README.md" to opened try using command 
"cat"
- but wait, why the password is xxxx?
- let's check the commit using "git log"
- there a 3 commit
- let's try previously git commit using command "git checkout"
- voila you get the next password "4pT1t5DENaYuqnqvadYs1oE4QLCdjmJ7"
