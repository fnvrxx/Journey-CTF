# The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the

#    human-readable
#    1033 bytes in size
#    not executable

solve:
fyi:
1. -b: to get the size in bytes
2. <command> |<pattern> : after | it takes the output the first command (pattern)
3. only look at files -type f (no dir/non-exec)

- first cd inhere
- after that using ls for look inside the inhere (or using ls -la)
- check it one by one (or using file ./* for make it fast a format file)
- based on https://mayadevbe.me/posts/overthewire/bandit/level6/
- we can use file */{.,}* | grep "ASCII text" | grep -v ', with very long lines' to make it fast
- using du command to filter it a size 
- command du -b -a | grep 1033  
- after that,check it is a file "with very long lines"
- and then using cat ./mayberhere07/.file2 and viola you got a password for the next level :)
