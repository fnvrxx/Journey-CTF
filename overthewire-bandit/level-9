# uniq is a command that filters input and writes to the output. 
# Specifically, it filters based on identical lines. It has a flag -u,which 
# filters for unique lines (lines that appear only ones). 
# The command is often used with sort. For uniq to filter for unique 
# lines, the lines need to be sorted. sort sorts the lines of a text file. 
# Furthermore, it has flags for sorting in reverse (-r) and sorting 
# numerically (-n).
so using command "sort data.txt | uniq -u"
