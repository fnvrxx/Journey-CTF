# There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: 
# it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a 
# commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and 
# compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the 
# password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level 
# (bandit21). /etc/bandit_pass/bandit21
solve: 
- ssh :openSSH remote login client 
- nc : arbitrary TCP and UDP connections and listens
- cat : concatenate files and print on the standard
- bash : GNU Bourne-Again Shell
- screen emulation : screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal
- tmux : terminal multiplexer

- first we know that file is binary.And if we running that file it is 
error because the program need port on localhost with TCP
- we need pass for bandit20 (using command "cat 
/etc/bandit_pass/bandit20")
- after that, using command "echo <pass_bandit20> | netcat -lp 1234 &"
- l it means listening and p is a set port, so basically -lp is listener 
on port that we set.And "&" is used to specify that we want the command to 
run in the background.
- Afterwards, using command "jobs" to see view all the processes/jobs on 
the system
- now let's we set using command "./suconnect 1234"
-voila you get a next passwords "EeoULMCra2q0dSkYj561DX7s1CpBuOBt"
