# The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is 
# a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level 
# it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work.Use 
# mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command 
# “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv(read 
# the manpages!)
# commands you may need to solve this level:
- grep : digunakan untuk mencari pola teks dalam file
- sort : mengurutkan baris dalam file teks berdasarkan huruf atau nilai
- uniq : menghapus baris yang berulang dalam file yang sudah diurutkan
- strings : menampilkan rangkaian karakter yang dapat dibaca manusia
- base64 : decoded atau encoded data dalam skema code base64
- tr : menggantikan atau menghapus karakter dari input lama ke input baru
- tar : digunakan untuk mengarsipkan file ke dalam satu file
- gzip : mengompres file menggunakan algoritma kompresi gnu
 -d :decompress
- xxd " membuat dump heksadesimal dari file biner atau mengonversi hexdump

solve:
- first using ls to check what kind of file
- after that, using command "cat data.txt" it seems that file a compress 
data as we know
- based on we know, we need to cp in somewhere it called "/tmp"
- so using command "cd /tmp"
- after that,command "mktemp -d" and then command "cd /tmp/<got in 
mktemp>"
- need cp a file data.txt., using command "cp ~/data.txt ."
- after that, change the format .txt to nothing (cause we know that file 
is not format .txt)
- using xxd -r hexdump (i called a file hexdump after change the format) > 
data
- after that, using command "file data" what kind of format file
- it looks that file format is gzip, so we need change the format to 
"data.gz"
- after that, using command "gunzip" to decompress that file
- look like there a file again but in not format, so we need to check it 
again using command "file data"
- after that,that file format is "bzip2" so we need to decompress that 
file using command "bunzip2 data"
- there a file called "data.out" like using before, using command "file 
data" to check it a format file
-turns on that file format is gzip, so we need change that format .out to 
.gz and compress using command "gunzip data.gz"
-after that, that format file change format tar, so we need decompress 
that file tar using command "tar -xf data" -x it means execute and -f it 
means used to spectify the filename
-it looks that file change again,it called format data6.bin with format 
bzip
-like we used before,repeat that..after that you get a password
-"the password is FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn"
