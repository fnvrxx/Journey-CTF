# The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password 
# of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First 
# find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which 
# of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next 
# credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.
solve:
commands you may need to solve this level:
ssh - OpenSSH remote login client
telnet - user interface to the TELNET protocol
nc - TCP/IP swiss army knife
s_client - SSL/TLS client program
nmap - Network exploration tool and security/port

from desc,we know we need to find out which of these port have a server listening.
so we can use command "nmap" to check them.
-to full command "nmap -sV -T4 -p 31000-32000 localhost"
 -sV it means to identify the versions of the sercices/Probe open ports to 
  determine service/version info
 -T4 it means to used to increase the speed of the scan/  -T<0-5>: Set timing 
  template (higher is faster)
 -p it means to specifity port
as we can see, port 31790 there is a service return message "Please enter the 
correct current passoword".So we need a password.

Now,we see that services is using SSL encryption.So we need openssl and s_client 
command to connect to the port and pass the password of the current user
commnad "openssl s_client --connect localhost:31790"
as you can see, there a input.So we need using password bandit16 (for a 
input).using command "cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit16" and the password for level16 
is kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx.And you get a RSA PRIVATE KEY (keep it in cd 
/tmp dir caused that only one can mkdir)
After that, using command "ssh -i private.key(filesname) bandit17@localhost -p 
2220"
and voila you get access level 17.
To get a password as usually "cat etc/bandit_pass/bandit16"
voila you get next password is EReVavePLFHtFlFsjn3hyzMlvSuSAcRD
