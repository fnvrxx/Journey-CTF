# The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 
# and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the 
# next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into 
# the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine 
# you are working on
solve:
# based on https://david-varghese.medium.com/overthewire-bandit-level-13-level-14-2f8611a72c7d
# to view what directory using command 'ls'
# there a file sshkey.private
# to connect bandit14 need to connect again using command ssh
# so, it should be "ssh -i sshkey.private -p 2220 bandit14@localhost"
# -i it means execute file flag sshkey.private
# -p it means port 
# bandit14@localhost is a target to execute it.
# voila you get connect bandit14@bandit
# to get a password you can using command "cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14"
