# The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) 
# letters have been rotated by 13 positions
solve:
# using command 'tr'  used to translate/ transform data from one form to another.
# as we know, the letter have been rotataed by 13 positions (it called a rot13)
- using command "cat data.txt | -tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
# remember tr <old_chars> <new_chars>
# and because rot13 so it must be 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'" because A->N...so on.
# read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13 for more information
- voila you get a password 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4
