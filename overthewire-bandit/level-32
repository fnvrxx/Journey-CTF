# There is a git repository at ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo via the port 2220. The 
# password for the user bandit31-git is the same as for the user bandit31.

# Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.
solve:
- same as level 31
- in file README.md we have a task that "
This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master"
- so we need to make a file called key.txt and the content "May I come 
in?"
- so we need make file using command echo "May I come in?" > key.txt
- before using git add. let's see if there a called .gitignore?(using 
command "ls -la")
- ahh there a .gitignore which *.txt (it means format .txt does'nt git 
add)
- so we need remove that gitignore using command "rm"
- after that using git add
- and git commit -m "Key.txt"
- and git push origin master and voila you get the next password
