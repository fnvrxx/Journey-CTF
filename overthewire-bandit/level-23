# A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the 
# time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and 
# see what command is being executed.

NOTE: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful 
skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If 
you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to 
see the debug information it prints.

solve :
-first we need to check dir in /etc/cron.d/ using command "cd"
-after that,using command "ls" to see what inside that file(s)
-because we want to know the next level so try using command "cat 
cronjob_bandit23"
-there a output "@reboot bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> 
/dev/null
* * * * * bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null"
-so try using command "cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh" to see the output
- afterwards, there a bash script 
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget
- try echo "I am user bandit23" | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
- there a bash "8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349"
- as you can see the bash script, is not a password but it is a file to a 
password so,using command "cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349 to 
see a password 
- voila you get a the next password "0Zf11ioIjMVN551jX3CmStKLYqjk54Ga"
