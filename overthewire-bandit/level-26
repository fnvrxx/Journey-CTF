# Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for 
# user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, 
# how it works and how to break out of it.
solve:
- ssh : OpenSSH remote login client
- cat : concatenate files and print on the standard output
- more : file perusal filter for crt viewing
- vi : Vi Improved, a programmer's text editor
- ls : list directory contents
- id : print real and effective user and group IDs
- pwd : print name of current/working directory

- To solve this, need to understand more and vim.Assume that you understand
- firsly we need connect bandit26 with command
- ssh bandit26@localhost -p 2220 -i bandit26.sshkey
- okay,we connect but after connect we logout(?)
- we know that bash bandit26 is not from "/bin/bash" so we need to know what sheell bandit26 used
- The “cat /etc/passwd | grep "bandit26" ” file consist of information regarding the users on the device along with the shell that is being used by each user.
- we need to know "cat /usr/bin/showtext" what inside is.
- okay, the point is shell used for bandit26 is used more
- firsly, we need to make small our terminal so we can used more (but before doing that, connect first!)
- after that "more" will be showed up
- we know that "more" is used like a vim (just type "v")
- so using command ":e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26" 
- and voila you get a password for bandit26 "s0773xxkk0MXfdqOfPRVr9L3jJBUOgCZ"
