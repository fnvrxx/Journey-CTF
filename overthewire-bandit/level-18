# There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. 
# The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line 
# that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new
solve:
cat :  concatenate files and print on the standard output
grep:  print lines that match patterns
ls : list directorty
diff :list different between files

- first using command "ls" theres a file passwords.old and passwords.new
- afterwards, using command "diff" to know difference two files
- '<' sign represents the lines that have removed and the '>' sign 
represents the lines that have been added in its place
- so the nex passwords is '42c42'x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO
