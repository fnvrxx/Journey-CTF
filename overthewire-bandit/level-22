# A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the 
# time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and 
# see what command is being executed.
solve :
 - cron : daemon to execute scheduled commands (Vixie Cron)
 - crontab: maintain crontab files for individual users
 - crontab(5) : tables for driving cron
first,we know that there a file in dir /etc/cron.d/ so let's we check it 
what insinde in that file.
Afterwards, we need to look at the cronjob for bandit22 there there is an 
shell script is being executed every second
(for detailed information on the syntax of cron jobs refer the attached 
resources) - MEDIUM DAVID-VARGHESE
So,we need look the contents of the scripts in dir 
/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
the output is
#!/bin/bash
chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv

- let's understand it one by one
- When we look at the script we see that it is creating an file called 
t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv in the /tmp directory and then saving the 
password for the next level into that file.
- chmod 644 it means only admin can access and modified file what admin 
wants
- so let's see what inside it, using command cat 
"/tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv"
-volia you get a  password for next level 
"tRae0UfB9v0UzbCdn9cY0gQnds9GF58Q"
