# The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:
#
#    owned by user bandit7
#    owned by group bandit6
#    33 bytes in size
solve:
# fyi                                                                         
ls          - list directory contents                                                                                                                 
cd          - change working directory
cat         - concatenate files and print on the standard output
file        - determine file type                                                      
find        - search for files in a directory hierarchy

command: find / type f -user bandit 7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
explanation simple
/:search entire directory
type f:search for only file
-user bandit7:search for files which are owned by user bandit7
-gorup bandit6:search for files that belongs to the group bandit6
-size 33c: look for files that exactly 33 bytes in size ("c" to represent 
size in bytes)
-if filtered out by sending error because permission denied
- adding 2> /dev/null (NULL is a special device on Linux which destroys all 
that fata is send to it)
- after that using command cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
- voila the next password:morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj
