solve:
- ssh: OpenSSH remote login client
- ls : list directory contents
- cat: concatenate files and print on the standard output

- To solve this we need to access to bash shell,as we know this server 
using ubuntu/linux so it should be in /bin/sh
- command "ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -t "/bin/sh" "
- $ it should be in bash
- try using "ls" there a file readme,to opened using "cat"
- voila, you get next password cGWpMaKXVwDUNgPAVJbWYuGHVn9zl3j8
